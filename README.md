# FixMySchool

FixMySchool.net was launched in spring 2012 with the goal of allowing middle school and high school students, teachers, and administrators to share ideas, comments, questions and suggestions about how to improve their schools. Users could create accounts and submit their ideas, then vote each individual submission up or down and add comments. The home page listed the most recent submissions, weighted by upvotes and downvotes using the Reddit homepage algorithm at the time, while other pages listed the all-time most upvoted submissions as well as the most common categories user submissions were falling into (facility complaints, poor teaching, etc). The site contained several other pages including polls and the ability for users to submit a longer overview of their educational experiences rather than short, individual thoughts. These longer submissions were then reviewed, with one being chosen each month as the "Biography of the Month."

This was my first project using Django, the Python-based web framework. At the time, of course, it was Python 2.x, combined on the front-end with jQuery (for effects and AJAX) and even StumbleUpon submission buttons! How things change... 

This project is no longer live and does not have a functioning demo site.
